### Hi 👋, I'm Naty👩‍💻.

I just graduated from Le Wagon. I love web development and everything about technology 🤖. Actually, I am very interested in working remotely, particularly for startups or companies where I can interact with Ruby on Rails or data modeling.
In Le Wagon we designed, implemented and shipped to production a clone of AirBnb and a Rails prototype : https://castlevania-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/ .For our Demo Day we launch a travel platform where the users can customize their Safari trips to Tanzania: https://www.tryabiona.com/.

Currently:
- 🌱 I am strengthening everything I learned at the bootcamp.
- 💬 Ask me about Ruby on Rails or PostgreSQL.
- 📫 How to reach me: natalygaol@gmail.com
- 💼 My Linkedin Profile: https://linkedin.com/in/nataly-garcía-oliva
- 😄 Pronouns: ella/she/her
- 📄 I want to learn Python as a second back-end language.
