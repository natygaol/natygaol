### Hi 👋, I'm Naty👩‍💻.

I love web development and everything about technology 🤖. I'm a curious human being, as such, I'm always reading about ⚖️politics, 🧠neuroscience, 💪human rights, minorities, 👩‍⚕️health, 📒education and 👩women in technology.

Currently:
- 🌱 I am strengthening everything I learned at the bootcamp.
- 💬 Ask me about Ruby on Rails or PostgreSQL| SQL.

- 😄 Pronouns: ella/she/her
- 💡 I'm passionate about E-Health and E-Learning, the two are areas where I have interacted my whole life, 50% of my family members are doctors and teachers and I    believe that with the help of technology, each person will be able to live in dignity.
- 📄 I want to learn Python as a second back-end language.
